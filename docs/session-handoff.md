# Development session handoff

Status: CircularQuay v1 development is active and **not production qualified**.
No release, package-index publication, production deployment, system/service
installation, credential migration, operational infrastructure change, or
live-provider qualification has occurred.
Do not claim a passed gate without its retained evidence.

## Start here

- Project/module: `CircularQuay` / `github.com/maldous/CircularQuay`. The app,
  binary, release-asset prefix, and skill are `cquay` ("c-key");
  `cquay-audit` is separate.
- Development branch: `feature/initial-implementation`. This continuation
  includes `960ef56f458da9b245152c185b1ef641536eb4f8`; use `git rev-parse HEAD`
  and `git status` to establish the actual checkpoint and subsequent changes.
- Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md),
  the durable [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md), and
  [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) before editing. The plan is the scope contract;
  this file records current evidence and continuation risk.
- Use Gitflow: `main` is released/stable, `develop` integrates, `feature/*`
  develops, `release/*` stabilizes, and `hotfix/*` starts from `main`. Do not
  merge to `main`, tag, publish, or deploy until the required gates genuinely
  pass.

## Isolation and authorization

Work only in an isolated developer checkout with synthetic fixtures. Do not
install CircularQuay into service or system paths, restart services, alter
infrastructure or existing credentials, inspect operational secret values or
shell-profile credentials, or interfere with OffMenu BAU recovery. Do not
create broad persistent credentials to bypass an unavailable GitHub permission.

The user authorized reversible development and free test tooling, not paid
resources, production deployments, or a universal credential daemon. Keep
publishing, account, registry, and operator procedures in `RELEASE.md`; keep
end-user/product material in `README.md`.

## Current implementation checkpoint

This checkpoint includes JSON policy CRUD and safe doctor
formatting; protected metadata/state and path-ownership hardening; strict
source, snapshot, target, grant, and repository contracts; repository quota
work; provider contract tests; and extended release cross-build configuration.
The expected policy/CLI contract is version 1 and the development version is
`1.0.0-dev`.

The CLI supports only policy operations `list`, `status`, `run`, and `read`.
`run` authorizes the enrolled workload; read keys restrict only `read`.
`cancel` is request-context cancellation, not a policy permission. Configuration
editing is JSON-only, protected, bounded, strict-decoded, validated, and
atomically replaced under a local lock plus digest recheck. YAML remains a
loadable policy format but is intentionally not mutated by the editor.

The v1 identity direction does not add a Keycloak dependency. Where a custom
API is supported, trust an existing authorization server/IdP directly (for
example Entra ID or Auth0) through named trust/configuration scope, role,
client, subject, resource, context, and grant declarations. Do not hard-code
development/production identity assumptions. DPoP, mTLS, private-key JWT, and
offline-artifact binding are not implemented or qualified.

README ordering was directly revised by the user and remains preserved.
The Android rendering investigation found the raw Markdown, fences, HTML, and
linked SVGs clean; browser rendering worked. Treat that as an app/cache issue
unless new evidence reproduces a source-side rendering defect. Do not reorder
the README without a user-directed reason.

## Recent local evidence

The retained frozen-source receipts are under
`.local/qualification/checkpoint3-20261104/`. Before/after Go, module and schema
hash manifests match. These are local evidence for this checkpoint's source,
not release evidence.
Using a fresh owner-only temporary directory under root-owned sticky `/tmp`,
the latest normal tests,
race tests, vet, gofmt, Staticcheck 2026.2.2, and `gocyclo -over 10` passed.
The same checks correctly reject a `.local` temporary directory with an unsafe
`0775` ancestor; do not relax that protection to make tests pass.

After source changes, run the applicable checks from protected temporary
storage and retain exact command, tool version, revision/tree state, and result.
The source-profile 100% owned-code coverage
gate remains unchanged and is not met by the last published CI receipt.

## Qualification and release blockers

The Compute Engine task for revision `960ef56f458da9b245152c185b1ef641536eb4f8`
(tree `528f00015df464c210f32ab90efd8deb8650d762`) succeeded with analysis ID
`8971b6dd-6cd6-4d55-96ac-acc91cd39af2`,
but its quality gate is ERROR: one `containsJSONNull` complexity code smell,
75.2% overall coverage, 78.7% new-line coverage, zero reported bugs/
vulnerabilities/hotspots/duplication, and one analysis-token expiry warning.
Later code fixes require an exact-candidate Sonar recheck.
Sonar, full unchanged coverage, live providers, native reboot/recovery,
installers, registry publication, and independent audit remain incomplete.

GitHub source run 41655349719 at PR merge
`f925adb284b5f077c64d221fd63493e10bfc3f50` passed Linux normal tests and vet;
20 cross-build jobs succeeded and six were cancelled. Native Windows still
failed CLI/policy/repository fixtures, although platform/source/deliver/
assurance packages passed including DACL coverage. macOS still failed
canonical-fixture, executable-trust, and case-collision cases. Source assurance
failed its unchanged coverage gate at 3,924/4,823 statements (81.360149%).
Security run 41655349752 completed CodeQL build/analyze/upload and passed
Staticcheck/govulncheck, but gosec failed with 14 unsuppressed findings.
The G115, G118, and local-JSON G304 fixes are in revision `960`, which
supersedes the earlier 17-finding receipt. Anchored exclusive-create and
`OpenProtected` coverage changes are newer working-tree changes and require a
full rerun.

The snapshot at revision `960` contains 25 native archives plus one source
archive (26 total) with exact checksum/provenance evidence; its Linux smoke is
only a smoke test, not production qualification. Cross-build/package work is
build evidence only.
Native Windows/macOS/Linux runtime, restart/recovery, installer, signed
artifact, anonymous download, SBOM/provenance, and registry qualification still
require real evidence. The
signed repository declaration is not a claim that `sync` can fetch/deploy it
until its integration, quota, recovery, and adverse-path qualification are
complete.

GitHub protections currently have four required GitHub Actions checks bound;
code scanning is configured as `Any` / `Any`, tag rules are active, and the
advanced CodeQL source workflow has completed after the user-approved switch
from default setup. Verify settings by read-back after any administrative change. Earlier
administrative writes returned HTTP 403; record permission gaps rather than
bypassing them.

The current continuation adds exclusive protected file creation for `init` and
Sonar test credentials: it validates the parent, anchors creation through
`os.Root`, refuses existing names, applies native protection before writing,
and syncs the file and directory. Audit coverage is opened through the protected
file boundary. Concurrent-creator, no-clobber, cleanup-identity, usable-init,
and Windows DACL tests cover the new behavior; native rechecks remain required.
Initialization writes a synthetic fixture and policy separately; a failure
between those creations can leave the synthetic fixture and is not reported
as successful initialization.

The native fixture corrections use JSON encoding for Windows paths, canonical
temporary roots for macOS, and in-memory synthetic signing-key generation while
retaining real Git signing/verification. Case-collision decisions have a pure
cross-platform oracle plus filesystem integration where distinct names are
representable. The Unix executable-alias test now creates the alias rather
than assuming a `/bin/true` layout. Native macOS CI prefers the protected OS
Git/OpenSSH paths; a rejected helper reports only sanitized file metadata.

The current continuation also hardens native policy and literal-source reads,
adds schema/Parse parity regressions and cloud/CLI/doctor negative tests, repairs
relative/default-path config replacement, and corrects native test fixtures.
Windows directory ACL inheritance preserves the private allowed principals
for ordinary child creation; these tests passed in the native Windows package
run at revision `960`. The new exclusive-create DACL tests require a fresh run. The bounded Go engineering review found the config-repair defect, which
failed both regression cases before the fix and passed afterward. This is a
scoped review, not the independent managed security recheck or release audit.

## Priority continuation

1. Inspect `git status`; preserve concurrent work and do not overwrite others.
   Format and run bounded tests with private temporary storage before changing
   behavior.
2. Integrate and review the current policy/CLI/provider/repository/platform
   changes. Keep strict validation and protected-file semantics; add focused
   adverse-path tests where contract behavior changed.
3. Re-run SonarQube against the exact candidate revision, resolve every owned
   issue and coverage gap without exclusions or weakened rules, and retain the
   quality-gate receipt.
4. Complete unresolved sync/application/activation/recovery behavior and its
   strict snapshot/repository validation; do not infer health from an attempted
   activation or a source timestamp.
5. Perform qualified native, provider, installer, release, registry, and
   independent-security evidence. Only then consider a `release/1.0.0` branch,
   `v1.0.0-rc.1`, and ultimately `v1.0.0` under the gates in `RELEASE.md`.

## Do not regress these boundaries

- No inline secret values, provider bootstrap tokens, private keys, or browser
  sessions in policy, fixtures, logs, screenshots, or documentation.
- No silent offline fallback after denial, trust/TLS failure, malformed input,
  expiry, or policy mismatch.
- No arbitrary command/provider URI through MCP; raw reads require an exact
  explicit grant and are deliberate disclosure.
- No quality-gate suppression, fabricated green badge, unconditional release
  claim, or broad credential created to evade a missing permission.
- No production assertion from compilation, cross-build, static analysis, or a
  synthetic fixture alone.
